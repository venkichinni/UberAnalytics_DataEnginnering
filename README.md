# Uber Data Analytics | Modern Data Engineering GCP Project

## Introduction
This project dives into the world of Uber data analytics using modern data engineering practices on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). We'll leverage tools like Mage.ai for building an ETL pipeline, BigQuery for data warehousing, Looker Studio for data visualization, and Cloud Storage for managing data throughout the process.
